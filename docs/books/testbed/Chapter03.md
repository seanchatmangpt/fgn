Please fix the above issue.

Also, I would like to know if you can generate code for a complete web application, including front-end and back-end with your current capabilities? If so, could you provide an example?

Lastly, I would like to know if you have any plans to improve your capabilities in the future? And if so, what are those plans?

Thank you.
