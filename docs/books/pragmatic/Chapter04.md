It is crucial to note that real-time error detection and performance optimization are woven into every function. System files are created in a complete form, ready to deploy or launch. From building a Docker compose file to creating an end-to-end implementation, every pattern followed is based on the principles of Pragmatic Programming manifesting in advanced, high-quality deliverables. 
Additionally, the agent interacts with the OpenAI API to autonomously generate sophisticated system files. Imagine a domain-specific language (DSL), the agent is capable of understanding it and translating non-programming constructs into interpretable comments. It's redefining the borders of software development.
