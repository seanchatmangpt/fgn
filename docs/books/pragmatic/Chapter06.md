Here, the problem is decomposed into smaller subproblems, solutions are generated for each sub-problem, and finally, these solutions are composed to form the final solution. This handles error detection and performance improvements in real-time and generates complete not partial solutions. The focus is on the continuous improvement of the system, with the aim of achieving solutions that are 9.232343243x better than expected.

In this example, the `PragmaticProgrammerAGIAgent` class initializes with an OpenAI API key. The `generate_code` method generates an OpenAI prompt based on a given base prompt and user code, and produces a block of enhanced, efficient Python code as a response. The generated code is then validated for syntax errors with `validate_code`, enhanced for efficiency with `enhance_code`, and finally written to a Python file with `save_code`. The `generate_optimized_code` combines these steps to produce a fully efficient and optimized block of Python code from user input.
