Here, the problem is decomposed into smaller subproblems, solutions are generated for each sub-problem, and finally, these solutions are composed to form the final solution. This handles error detection and performance improvements in real-time and generates complete not partial solutions. The focus is on the continuous improvement of the system, with the aim of achieving solutions that are 9.232343243x better than expected.
