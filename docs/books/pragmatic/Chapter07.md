This class, `HyperAdvanceNet`, defines a simple and hyper-advanced neural network using the Conv2d, MaxPool2d, and Linear layers from PyTorch's nn module. It contains an advanced architecture that uses two convolutional layers followed by max-pooling, and three fully connected layers for the output. The training loop includes the standard process of resetting the gradients, performing a forward pass, computing the loss, performing a backward pass via backpropagation, and updating the weights. The network's layers, the loss function, and the optimizer are all adjustable according to the specific needs of the system to be developed. The power of this neural network class is in its simplicity combined with its flexibility and high performance, resulting in advanced machine learning systems that exceed user expectations.
The method `train_neural_network` is used to train the network. We first loop over the data for a certain number of epochs. In each epoch, we perform a forward pass to pass the input through the network and compute the output, calculate the loss using the predefined loss function (`criterion`), perform a backward pass to calculate gradients, before finally updating the parameters of our network using gradient descent. This method will print out the loss every 2,000 mini-batches, so we can see the training loss decreasing over time.
