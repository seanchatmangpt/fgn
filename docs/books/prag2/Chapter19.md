With the continuous growth of open source projects and platforms, learning how to contribute to them has never been more important. Pytest with Pyfakefs is one such project that seeks the help of programmers worldwide to advance its development. If you're eager to contribute but find the process daunting, this step-by-step guide may just be what you need.

### Step 1: Familiarize Yourself with Pytest & Pyfakefs

Before you contribute, it's crucial to have a good understanding of the tools. Spend some time learning how Pytest and Pyfakefs work, read their documentations, and try using them in your projects.

### Step 2: Find a Bug or a Need

Look for open issues in the GitHub repository, or identify an improvement you think Pytest or Pyfakefs could benefit from. The issue could be a bug, a security vulnerability, or even a new feature request.

### Step 3: Fork & Clone the Repository 

To make changes to the project, you first need to make a copy of the repository on your own GitHub account. Do this by 'forking' the repository. Then, 'clone' this forked repository onto your local system for easier manipulation.

### Step 4: Create a New Branch

Instead of working directly on the master branch, create a new branch. Naming it after the issue or enhancement you're working on can help keep things organized.

### Step 5: Make Your Changes 

Now, it's time to start working on your chosen issue or enhancement. Ensure your changes follow the project's coding style guidelines and write clear, concise code.

### Step 6: Run the Tests

Before submitting your code, run all the existing tests to ensure that your changes haven't broken anything. If applicable, write new tests that cover your changes.

### Step 7: Commit & Push Your Changes 

Commit your changes with a clear, informative message describing the enhancement or bug fix you made. Push your committed changes to the branch in your GitHub repository.

### Step 8: Open a Pull Request 

Finally, go to your GitHub repository and open a new pull request against the original project repository. Provide a detailed description of the changes you made, link the issue number, and submit.

Remember, contributing to open source is not just about writing code. It involves effective communication and collaboration abilities, learning to listen and respond to feedback constructively, and having a willingness to continually learn and grow. Navigating these steps might seem challenging at first, but with practice and a desire to make an impact, you will become a valuable contributor to the Pytest and Pyfakefs project.
