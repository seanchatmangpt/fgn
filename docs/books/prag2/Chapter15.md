Effective debugging and troubleshooting are essential skills for any Python developer. This article outlines how to debug and troubleshoot when testing with `pytest` and `pyfakefs`.

### Step 1: Setup pytest and pyfakefs

Firstly, `pytest` and `pyfakefs` need to be installed. These can be added to your Python environment using PIP: 

```
pip install pytest pyfakefs
```

### Step 2: Write a test case

Next, write a simple test case. Create a Python file and a simple function that reads a file and returns the first line. Write a test that creates a fake file in a fake filesystem and tests if the function correctly returns the first line.

```python
def test_read_first_line(fs):
    # Setup - create test data
    fs.create_file('/test', contents='Line 1\nLine 2\n')

    # Exercise - run the function
    result = read_first_line('/test')

    # Verify - check the result
    assert result == 'Line 1\n'
```

### Step 3: Debug a failed test

If your test is failing, there are several debugging tools and tactics at your disposal: 
- Read the error message: `pytest` provides detailed output on why a test failed. This can often point you in the right direction.
- Debug print statements: Use `print()` statements in your function to display variables and program flow. This can be useful for understanding why a function isn't behaving as expected.
- Post-mortem Debugger (`pdb`): Activate the `pdb` debugger in case of failure by running pytest with the --pdb flag `pytest --pdb`.

### Step 4: Test Exceptions 

Ensure your functions handle errors expectedly. You can use pytest's `raises()` method to assert that a function throws an exception when it should.

```python
def test_read_non_existent_file(fs):
    # Ensure an error is raised when trying to read a file that doesn't exist
    with pytest.raises(FileNotFoundError):
        read_first_line('/there_is_no_such_file')
```

### Step 5: Using pytest fixtures

If you find yourself repeating the same setup code in multiple tests, it might be wise to use pytest fixtures. Fixtures are functions that are run by pytest before your tests. They are used to feed some data to the tests.

```python
@pytest.fixture
def fs_setup(fs):
    # Create a fake file
    fs.create_file('/test', contents='Line 1\nLine 2\n')
    return '/test'
```

Now you can use `fs_setup` as an argument in your test functions, and pytest will provide them the return value of the `fs_setup` fixture.

### Step 6: Troubleshoot pyfakefs gotchas

Watch out for a few common gotchas with `pyfakefs`:
- Remember to pass the filesystem (`fs`) fixture to every test that uses `pyfakefs`.
- Be careful with modules that use the filesystem at import time. These modules should be imported inside the test function, not at the module level.

Equipped with these steps and strategies, you should be able to effectively troubleshoot and debug your Python tests using `pytest` and `pyfakefs`. As with all programming endeavors, practice and patience are key. Happy debugging!

Title: "Customizing the Pragmatic Starter Kit CLI: A Step-by-Step Guide"

Introduction:
The Pragmatic Starter Kit CLI is a powerful tool for automating development, deployment, and maintenance tasks. However, to fully leverage its potential, it is essential to customize it to suit your specific needs. In this step-by-step guide, we will walk you through the process of customizing the Pragmatic Starter Kit CLI, allowing you to tailor it to your project requirements.

Step 1: Install Pragmatic Starter Kit CLI and Review Available Options

Before customizing the Pragmatic Starter Kit CLI, ensure that it is installed on your system. You can do this by following the installation instructions provided in the documentation. Once installed, familiarize yourself with the available options by running the command:

```
prak --help
```

This will display a list of available options and commands that can be customized.

Step 2: Customize the Pragmatic Starter Kit CLI Configuration

To tailor the Pragmatic Starter Kit CLI to your project, you can create a project-specific configuration file. Start by creating a `.prakrc` file in the root directory of your project. This file will contain your custom configuration options.

Open the `.prakrc` file in a text editor and add the desired configuration options. For example, you can specify default values for certain options, define custom commands, or configure environment-specific settings.

Step 3: Create Custom Commands

The Pragmatic Starter Kit CLI allows you to define custom commands to automate specific tasks unique to your project. To create a custom command, open the `.prakrc` file and add a new section under the `[commands]` heading.

Define the name of your custom command, along with the associated script or executable, and any additional options or arguments required. Save the `.prakrc` file when you are done.

Step 4: Test and Validate Customizations

To ensure that your customizations are working correctly, run the Pragmatic Starter Kit CLI with your changes. Use the available commands and options, including your custom commands, to perform various tasks related to your project.

Verify that the CLI behaves as expected and that your custom commands execute successfully. Make any necessary adjustments to your configuration or commands if issues arise.

Step 5: Share and Document Customizations

If you are working with a team or planning to distribute your project, it is essential to share and document your customizations. Include the `.prakrc` file in your project repository and provide clear instructions for other team members to set up and use the customized Pragmatic Starter Kit CLI.

Additionally, consider creating documentation or a README file that explains the purpose of each custom command and the configuration options you have customized. This will help others understand and leverage your customizations effectively.

Step 6: Update and Maintain Customizations

As your project evolves, you may need to update your customizations. Regularly review and update the `.prakrc` file to ensure that it aligns with the current requirements and best practices of your project.

Periodically revisit your custom commands and configuration options to identify any potential improvements or optimizations. Regular maintenance will ensure that your customizations continue to enhance your workflow and productivity.

Conclusion:
Customizing the Pragmatic Starter Kit CLI allows you to tailor it to your project's specific needs and automate development, deployment, and maintenance tasks efficiently. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can leverage the full potential of the Pragmatic Starter Kit CLI and streamline your project workflows. Experiment with different configurations and commands to find the setup that best suits your requirements. Happy customizing!
