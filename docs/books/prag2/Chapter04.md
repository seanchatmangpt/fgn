Automated testing is a crucial aspect of software development. It enables developers to swiftly find and resolve bugs, ensuring the delivery of high-quality software. This practical guide has been created to help you get started with automated testing using Python's pytest and pyfakefs.

**Step 1: Understanding Pytest and pyfakefs**

1. **Pytest** is a robust, feature-rich and popular testing framework in Python. It simplifies the process of writing simple, as well as scalable, tests. It automatically detects and runs tests, enabling effective test discovery. 

2. **Pyfakefs** is a pytest plugin for Python's unit test framework. It mimics Python's file system modules and offers a fake file system that replaces Python's file system modules in tests.

**Step 2: Installing Pytest and pyfakefs**

To get started, you first need to install Pytest and pyfakefs using pip.
```python
pip install pytest
pip install pyfakefs
```

**Step 3: Creating Your First Test**

Make a directory called `tests` in your project's root directory. Inside this directory, create a Python file for your tests, let's call it `test_sample.py`.
The fake file system is accessible via the `fs` fixture in pytest:

```python
def test_dummy(fs):
    # test using fs here
```

**Step 4: Writing Tests Using pyfakefs**

Setting up a fake file in pyfakefs is quite easy. The fake file system is initialized empty, and you can create files and directories using the `create_file()` method.

```python
# test_sample.py

def test_fake_file(fs):
    # Arrange
    fs.create_file("/var/test.txt", contents="Hello, World!")
  
    # Act
    with open("/var/test.txt") as f:
        result = f.read()

    # Assert
    assert result == "Hello, World!"
```
This test validates that the file '/var/test.txt' is created correctly and contains the right data.

**Step 5: Running the Tests**

After writing your tests, you can run them using the pytest command in your terminal.

```bash
pytest
```
Pytest will automatically discover all the test cases in your project that are named in the form `test_*.py` or `*_test.py`, then execute them. 

**Step 6: Understanding the Test Results**

The pytest framework is intuitive and offers a detailed rundown of test results, enabling you to spot and fix any bugs. If your test case passes, it will display a dot (.) and for failure, it'll display an 'F'.

**Step 7: Expanding Your Tests**

With the basic setup complete, you can start expanding your tests. You branch out and create complex file structures, load real file data into the fake file system, and more. Always remember the principles of a good unit test: it should be automated, thorough, repeatable, independent, and professional.

Congratulations! You've just learned how to implement Pytesting with pyfakefs for your Python applications. Take a ride on this efficient mode of testing and enjoy the simplicity and robustness it offers.

manage_docker_environment()
```
This function first creates a Docker client using `docker.from_env()`, which will automatically configure the client using environment variables. 
Next, it will list all running Docker containers and stop each one. 
Then, it removes all containers, whether they are running or not. 
After cleaning up the Docker environment, it builds a Docker image for your application. 
This requires your application and a Dockerfile to be in the current working directory. 
After the image has been built, your application is run in a new Docker container. 
Finally, the status of the container is checked and a message is printed if the application is running. 

This function is a simple example and may need to be adapted for more complex Docker environments or specific application requirements. Be mindful that this function will stop and remove all Docker containers, so it should be used with caution on a system with other Docker containers running.
