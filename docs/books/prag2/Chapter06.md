In the world of software development, testing and continuous integration (CI) are fundamental practices that help to ensure the quality and reliability of your code. This guide will walk you through implementing Pytesting with pyfakefs as well as integrating continuous integration using Git Actions.

**Step 1: Introduction to Pytest and pyfakefs**

Pytest is a popular testing tool for Python. It simplifies the process of writing and running tests and offers a variety of features like assert rewriting and useful plugins. One such plugin is pyfakefs, which provides a fake file system that mimics Python's file & directory I/O functions.

**Step 2: Installing Pytest and pyfakefs**

Ensure you have the latest version of Python installed on your system before starting. You can install both Pytest and pyfakefs using pip, the Python package installer. Run the following commands in your terminal:
```bash
pip install pytest
pip install pyfakefs
```

**Step 3: Writing Tests Using Pytest and pyfakefs**

Let's assume you have a Python function that creates a directory and writes some text into a file in that directory. Here's a simple test for this function using pytest and pyfakefs:

```python
def test_create_file(fs):  # fs is the reference to the fake file system
    fs.create_dir('/test')
    with open('/test/example.txt', 'w') as file:
        file.write('Hello, World!')
    assert os.path.exists('/test/example.txt') is True
```
In this test, the `fs` argument is a fixture provided by pyfakefs that sets up the fake file system.

**Step 4: Understanding Git Actions**

GitHub Actions is a CI/CD platform that allows you to automate software workflows directly in GitHub. Actions can automate tasks like building, testing, and deploying your code based on a defined trigger. 

**Step 5: Setting Up Git Actions for Python Application**

First, on GitHub, navigate to your repository and click on the "Actions" tab. Then, select the "Python package" workflow. This will create a new file under `.github/workflows/python-package.yml`. We'll use this file to tell GitHub how to handle our Python package's testing and deployment.

**Step 6: Configuring the Python-Testing Git Action**

The python-package workflow file has a block of code dedicated to pytest testing. We modify this section to install our project's dependencies (including pytest and pyfakefs), and then run our tests:

```yaml
...
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install pytest pyfakefs
        if [ -f requirements.txt ]; then pip install -r requirements.txt; fi
    - name: Test with pytest
      run: |
        pytest
```
This will ensure that our tests are run in the GitHub Actions environment when we push changes to our repository.

**Step 7: Pushing Changes and Viewing the Action**

Once you've committed this workflow file to your repository (ensure to do so in the master or main branch), Github Actions becomes active. You can view the progress and outcome of your workflows by clicking the "Actions" tab in your repository.

By following these steps, you should have successful integration of Pytesting with pyfakefs and continuous integration using Git Actions. This can greatly aid in automating the testing process, ensuring seamless development and deployment.
