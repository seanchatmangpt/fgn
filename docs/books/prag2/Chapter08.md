Keeping track of different versions of your code and managing them effectively can sometimes be a daunting task. However, working with Python's Pytest and pyfakefs libraries can significantly reduce these complexities. This guide will walk you through the steps of how to use these tools to implement version control strategies.

**Step 1: Setup Your Environment**

Before you start, ensure Python is installed on your system. Subsequently, you can install the Pytest and pyfakefs libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pytest
pip install pyfakefs
```

**Step 2: Initialize a Git Repository**

Begin by initializing a Git repository in your project directory. This will allow you to track changes and create different versions of your code.

```bash
git init
```

**Step 3: Create Your Code and Tests**

After setting up your repository, write your Python code and the corresponding tests using Pytest. Ensure you simulate your file system with `pyfakefs` for testing functions that perform file operations.

**Step 4: Commit Your Changes**

Commit any changes you make to your code. This helps to keep a record of different versions of your project. Use clear and concise commit messages to describe what changes each commit makes.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

**Step 5: Run Your Tests**

Before pushing changes or merging branches, always run tests to ensure that your code is working as expected. You can achieve this by simply running the pytest command in your terminal.

```bash
pytest
```

**Step 6: Create Branches for New Features**

When adding new features to your code, it's a good practice to create a new branch. This way, you can work on new features without affecting the main version of your code.

```bash
git checkout -b feature/new_feature
```

**Step 7: Merge Your Changes**

Once your tests for the feature have passed, and you are confident in your changes, merge your feature branch back into the main branch.

```bash
git checkout main
git merge feature/new_feature
```

And voila! By following these steps, you can effectively manage different versions of your code with Pytest and pyfakefs, and ensure that they work correctly. Happy coding!
