Performing regression testing and full automation in a project is an integral part of software development. It provides confidence in the software's reliability, especially when changes and updates are continually being implemented. Python's Pytest and pyfakefs tools are valuable when performing these operations. This guide will walk you through the process of regression testing and automating your test running using these tools.

**Step 1: Install Required Tools**
  
You will need Pytest for the testing process, while pyfakefs will help mock the filesystem. To install, run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
pip install pytest
pip install pyfakefs
```

**Step 2: Set Up Your Project**

Create your project directory and within it, create two more directories for your source codes and tests. Navigate to these directories and create the necessary Python files. For instance:

```bash
mkdir MyProject
cd MyProject
mkdir src
cd src
touch myprogram.py
cd ..
mkdir tests
cd tests
touch test_myprogram.py
cd ..
```

**Step 3: Write Your Code**

Within `myprogram.py`, write your Python code. Perform functions that interact with the file system.

**Step 4: Write Your Tests**

In the file `test_myprogram.py`, write your tests. Use pyfakefs to create a fake filesystem. Pyfakefs works by replacing modules that interact with the file system, so your tests will run on a fake filesystem, ensuring no changes are made to the real file system during testing.

**Step 5: Run Your Tests**

With your code and tests written, run your tests using the following command:

```bash
pytest
```

**Step 6: Automate Your Tests**

You can automate your tests using GitHub Actions or any other CI/CD tool you prefer. This way, anytime changes are made to your code, tests will run automatically to ensure that no bugs or breaks are introduced with the code changes.

To automate the running of your tests, create a `yml` file within a `.github\workflows` directory in your project.

Within the `yml` file, instruct GitHub actions to run your tests anytime a push is made to your repository. Your file might look something like this:

```yml
name: Python Varification
on: [push]
jobs:
  python-verification:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Project
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set Up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v1
        with:
          python-version: '3.8'
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: pip install pytest pyfakefs
      - name: Run Tests
        run: pytest
```

By following these steps, you can efficiently perform regression testing and full automation in your Python project using Pytest and pyfakefs.

**Title: How to Monitor and Optimize Performance with Pragmatic Starter Kit CLI**

```bash
prak init
```

This command will set up the necessary configuration files and directories for your project.

**Step 3: Monitor the System**
The Pragmatic Starter Kit CLI provides a command to monitor your system for potential issues and performance bottlenecks. Run the following command to start monitoring:

```bash
prak monitor
```

This command will collect and display information about system resources, including CPU usage, memory usage, and disk operations. It will also provide real-time insights into potential issues, such as high CPU usage or memory leaks.

**Step 4: Analyze and Optimize**
Based on the information displayed during monitoring, you can analyze the performance of your system and identify areas for optimization. Look for patterns of high resource usage or any anomalies that might indicate potential performance issues.

Once you have identified areas for optimization, you can use the Pragmatic Starter Kit CLI to implement performance improvements. For example, you can use the `prak scale` command to scale services or components up or down to optimize resource allocation. Alternatively, you can use the `prak optimize` command to optimize code and system resources for production.

**Step 5: View Logs**
The Pragmatic Starter Kit CLI also allows you to view logs for specified parts of the system. Logs can provide valuable insights into system behavior and help identify potential issues. Use the `prak log` command to view logs. For example, to view logs for a specific component, run the following command:

```bash
prak log component_name
```

Replace "component_name" with the name of the component you want to view logs for.

**Step 6: Test and Iterate**
After implementing optimizations, it's crucial to test your system to ensure that performance improvements have been successfully applied. Use the Pragmatic Starter Kit CLI's `prak test` command to run unit, integration, and end-to-end tests to verify the stability and performance of your system.

After running tests, gather feedback from users and stakeholders to identify any remaining performance issues or areas for improvement. Incorporate this feedback into your development cycle and iterate on your optimizations as needed.

**Conclusion**
By following these steps and leveraging the capabilities of the Pragmatic Starter Kit CLI, you can effectively monitor and optimize the performance of your software project. Regular monitoring, analysis, and performance optimization will help you ensure that your system runs smoothly, providing a positive user experience and maintaining the quality of your software project.

In order to perform regression testing and full automation using Pytest and pyfakefs, you can follow the following steps:

**Step 1: Install Required Tools**
To begin, you need to install Pytest and pyfakefs. You can do this by running the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
pip install pytest
pip install pyfakefs
```

**Step 2: Set Up Your Project**
Create a directory for your project and within it, create two subdirectories, one for your source code and another for your tests. Navigate to the source code directory and create a Python file for your program. Similarly, navigate to the tests directory and create a Python file for your tests. Here's an example of how to do this in the terminal:

```bash
mkdir MyProject
cd MyProject
mkdir src
cd src
touch myprogram.py
cd ..
mkdir tests

To automate the running of your tests, you can use a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) tool like GitHub Actions. Create a YAML file (e.g., `.github/workflows/python-verification.yml`) in your project's repository with the following content:

```yaml
name: Python Verification
on: [push]
jobs:
  python-verification:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout Repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set Up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v1
      with:
        python-version: '3.x' # Replace with your desired Python version
    - name: Install Dependencies
      run: pip install pytest pyfakefs
    - name: Run Tests
      run: pytest
```

This YAML file sets up the necessary steps for installing dependencies, such as Pytest and pyfakefs, and running the tests using the Pytest command whenever a push is made to your repository. With this automation in place, your tests will be run automatically, providing continuous feedback on the stability and reliability of your code.

By following these steps, you can perform regression testing and full automation in your Python project using Pytest and pyfakefs.

```python
#import PragmaticProgrammerAGIAgent

# Hyper advanced code
# Tracer code is not disposable: you write it for keeps. It contains
# all the error checking, structuring, documentation, and selfchecking
# that any piece of production code has. It simply is not
# fully functional. However, once you have achieved an end-toend
# connection among the components of your system, you can
# check how close to the target you are, adjusting if necessary.
# Once you’re on target, adding functionality is easy.
# Tracer development is consistent with the idea that a project is
# never finished: there will always be changes required and
# functions to add. It is an incremental approach.
