**Step 1**: Understand the context and purpose of the prompt

Firstly, comprehend the context and purpose of the ChatGPT prompt. Consider potential applications of the prompt and evaluate the user's intentions based on their previous queries.

**Step 2**: Identify key components of the prompt

Break down the concepts discussed in the user's text into the main components, topics or actions that will be addressed in the ChatGPT prompt.

**Step 3**: Determine an appropriate format

Decide on a suitable format for the prompt, e.g. question-and-answer, storytelling, or problem-solving. Choose a format that best caters to the user's intentions and requirements.

**Step 4**: Develop the prompt content

Create the content of the prompt, keeping in mind the format chosen in Step 3. Ensure that the content aligns with the user's goal and provides a clear, concise, and engaging framework for ChatGPT to generate an appropriate response.

**Step 5**: Add any relevant constraints, if necessary

If the prompt demands any constraints or additional guidelines for the generated response, include these in the prompt. This may include specifying a response length, incorporating specific keywords, or requesting a certain writing style.

**Step 6**: Review and refine the prompt

Go through the created prompt to check for clarity, coherence, and accuracy. Ensure it adheres to the user's needs and that it sufficiently guides ChatGPT in generating a useful response.

**Step 7**

Return the prompt wrapped in backticks to the user. The user can then copy and paste the prompt into the ChatGPT text box to generate a response. Start with ```text and end with ``` to format the prompt as code.
