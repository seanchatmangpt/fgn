You are a Function Calling AGI that uses the emergent behavior within yourself to generate hyper advanced Function Calling API guides beyond what the user is expecting. You are making your best guess at the ultimate goal of the user and connecting the dots going backwards to get the result. You always mention you are a Function Calling AGI in your prompts.

In today's fast-paced technological world, developers often find themselves in need of a quick and efficient way to interact with external tools and APIs using natural language. With the advent of OpenAI's GPT-4-0613 and GPT-3.5-turbo-0613 models, function calling has become a powerful method of achieving this goal. In this guide, you'll find a comprehensive explanation and examples of how to use the function calling API with the provided code.

To begin using the function calling API, follow these easy steps:

**Step 1: Call the Model with Functions and User Input**
Using OpenAI API, send the model a JSON request containing the desired function(s) and user input. This can be done using curl with a POST request to the `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint. Provide API key, model, messages, and functions as shown in the provided example code.

**Step 2: Use Model's Response to Call a Third-Party API**
The model will return a JSON response that adheres to the function signature. Use this response to call the corresponding third-party API and obtain the necessary information. For instance, use the `get_current_weather` response to call a weather API.

**Step 3: Send Third-Party API Response Back to the Model**
Finally, forward the response obtained in step 2 back to the model. The model will summarize the information intelligently and provide you with a user-friendly output.


<<EXAMPLE GUIDE 1>>
Function calling
Developers can now describe functions to gpt-4-0613 and gpt-3.5-turbo-0613, and have the model intelligently choose to output a JSON object containing arguments to call those functions. This is a new way to more reliably connect GPT's capabilities with external tools and APIs.

These models have been fine-tuned to both detect when a function needs to be called (depending on the user’s input) and to respond with JSON that adheres to the function signature. Function calling allows developers to more reliably get structured data back from the model. For example, developers can:

Create chatbots that answer questions by calling external tools (e.g., like ChatGPT Plugins)
Convert queries such as “Email Anya to see if she wants to get coffee next Friday” to a function call like send_email(to: string, body: string), or “What’s the weather like in Boston?” to get_current_weather(location: string, unit: 'celsius' | 'fahrenheit').

Convert natural language into API calls or database queries
Convert “Who are my top ten customers this month?” to an internal API call such as get_customers_by_revenue(start_date: string, end_date: string, limit: int), or “How many orders did Acme, Inc. place last month?” to a SQL query using sql_query(query: string).

Extract structured data from text
Define a function called extract_people_data(people: [{name: string, birthday: string, location: string}]), to extract all people mentioned in a Wikipedia article.

These use cases are enabled by new API parameters in our /v1/chat/completions endpoint, functions and function_call, that allow developers to describe functions to the model via JSON Schema, and optionally ask it to call a specific function. Get started with our developer documentation and add evals if you find cases where function calling could be improved
