Have you ever found yourself in the position where you have a side project that could potentially disrupt the industry you're in, but you're not sure how to tell your VP about it? It can be a nerve-wracking situation, but with the right approach, you can present your idea in a way that is professional, effective, and well-received. Here's how:

1. Research and Preparation:
First, do your homework. Gather all relevant data and information on your project, including its potential impact on the industry, competitors, and customers. Understand the risks and benefits of the project. Then, organize the information in a clear and compelling way, such as a slide deck presentation, executive summary, or detailed report.

2. Schedule a Meeting:
Once you have your presentation prepared, schedule a meeting with your VP. Choose a time that is convenient for both of you and ensure there's sufficient time to discuss your project.

3. Clarify Connections:
Begin by aligning your side project with the core objectives of your department. Explain how your project complements existing projects, contributes to overall goals and how it could provide an advantage in your field. Highlight any potential cost savings or increase in revenue through your project.

4. Share the Details:
As you present the project, share specific details about its components, target audience, and the competitive leverage it provides. Ensure that you provide a clear value proposition along with any data that backs up your claims. Use visuals such as graphs, charts or videos to help explain the details.

5. Address Potential Challenges:
While presenting, don't shy away from discussing potential challenges and drawbacks your project may face. Acknowledge any risks and show your VP how you plan to mitigate them. Highlight your awareness of these challenges and your ability to overcome them.

6. Ask for Feedback:
It's essential to ask for feedback and input from your VP. Ask if there are specific questions you can answer or any areas of the project they want to focus on. Take the feedback constructively and modify your approach, if necessary.

7. Thank Them:
At the end of the presentation, thank your VP for their time and their attention. Show them how much you value their support and input, and that you recognize their time is valuable.

In conclusion, when presenting a side project that could disrupt the industry to your VP, it's essential to prepare thoroughly and present your idea in a way that aligns with your department's goals. Ensure that your presentation is clear, compelling and presents a solid value proposition. Be open to feedback, and make modifications if necessary. By following these steps, you can increase your chances of success in convincing the VP about the value of your side project.


Great job on outlining the steps to present a side project to a VP. Here are a few suggestions to improve the content:

1. Use a Hook:
Start with a hook that engages the VP's interest. For example, you could use statistics or numbers to highlight the potential impact of the project. This will make them understand the urgency and importance of the project.

2. Define the Target Market:
Be specific about the target market of your project. Explain why this specific audience is crucial, and what value your project can provide to them. This will help your VP understand the scope of your project.

3. Prepare a Demo:
Consider preparing a demo of your project so that your VP can see the final product or how it works. A demo can go a long way in communicating the value of your project to stakeholders.

4. Customize Communication Style:
Understand your VP's communication style and tailor your presentation accordingly. For example, if your VP is more data-focused, provide more statistics and analytics. If your VP is a visual learner, use more images, graphs, and charts.

5. Provide Follow-up:
After your presentation, provide follow-up with documentation or additional information requested by the VP. This shows that you are proactive and committed to the project's success.

By implementing these suggestions, you can take your presentation to the next level, and effectively communicate the value of your side project to your VP.
