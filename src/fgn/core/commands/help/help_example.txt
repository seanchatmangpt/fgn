First, you'll need to open the Command Prompt. You can do this by searching for "cmd" in the Start menu or by pressing the Windows key + R and typing "cmd" in the Run dialog box.

Once you have the Command Prompt open, you can use fgn by following these simple steps:

1. Navigate to the directory where fgn is installed
   For example, if fgn is installed in the "C:\fgn" directory, type `cd C:\fgn`

2. Type `fgn` followed by the command and any necessary arguments
   For example, to create a business plan, you would type `fgn -o business_plan.txt plan "My Business Plan"`

3. Press Enter to execute the command and create the desired output.

You can also view the available options and commands by typing `fgn help` in the Command Prompt.
