The design phase for the Auto GPT system includes the following steps:

1. **Define Ubiquitous Language:**
    This involves documenting a shared language related to the domain model of the Auto GPT system. It's crucial for ensuring consistency and mutual understanding across all levels of collaboration — from developers to stakeholders. 

2. **Draw Domain Model:**
    Develop a domain model to illustrate the system's key components and how they interact with each other. This will serve as the blueprint for setting the context of the system design and implementation.

3. **List Domain Events:**
    Identifying the domain events, which includes significant occurrences or state changes within the system's ecosystem — for example, 'a user query is submitted' or 'an output is generated'. 

4. **Define Domain Services:**
    These are operations where some process or industrial logic needs to be performed. For example, leaning, formatting, loading a model, processing a query, and handling errors.

## Timeframe:

The estimated timeline for the system design phase is 1-2 weeks. This timeline ensures accuracy and efficiency while accommodating necessary modifications.

## Resources Required:

1. Tools for creating system design documents, such as UML Software like Lucidchart or Visual Paradigm.
2. Collaborative Platforms for accumulating inputs from stakeholders and team members.
3. Architecture design resources to assist in building a scalable, robust, and efficient system.

## Review:

Each phase gets reviewed for ensuring alignment with project requirements. For the system design phase, review checks will focus on the model's ability to handle various tasks efficiently and the soundness of the domain events and services identified.

## Future Steps:

Post this phase, the plan will move forward to the core implementation phase. This includes developing the modules as per the system design. Emphasis will be on creating test modules to ensure each portion of the code works as expected for robust software development.
